Python Conditions

Equals 						->	x  ==  y
Not Equals 					->  x  !=  y
Less than 					->  x  <   y
Less than or equal to 		->  x  <=  y
Greater than 				->  x  >   y
Greater than  or equal to 	->  x  >=  y
Boolean OR					->  x  or  y, x | y	 
Boolean AND 				-> 	x  and y, x & y 
Boolean NOT					->  not x
